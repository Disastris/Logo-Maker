The steps to install this program are to first download the repo into your local computer. Once it's finished downloading you will need to enter your terminal of the files and type in the command "npm install". It should download the required files that are needed, if need be check on the that package.json file and make sure that the dependencies are "inquirer" and "Jest" are inside them.
## Usage
Once confirmed you will open the terminal and type in the command "node index.js" to initate the program. The program will ask you some prompts and you answer them as honestly as you can and or to what you need. Once done the program will give you a message letting you know that the logo has been created and it should create a seperate file in your local computer for you to be able to use!
